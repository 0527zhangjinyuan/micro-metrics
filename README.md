# micro-metrics

This is a PhD level course in Microeconometrics targeted at students conducting applied research (as opposed to econometricians).

In addition to traditional econometric approaches, this course draws connections to recent literature on machine learning.

It is based on some combination of 
- [Microeconometrics by Cameron and Trivedi](https://www.amazon.com/Microeconometrics-Methods-Applications-Colin-Cameron/dp/0521848059)
- [Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)
- Other lectures borrowed/stolen from various sources

The goal is to provide an overview of a number of topics in Microeconometrics including:

1. Nonparametrics and Identification
2. Model Selection and Penalized Regression
3. Treatment Effects and Selection
4. Binary Discrete Choice (including endogeneity)
5. Multinomial Discrete Choice
6. Dynamic Discrete Choice
7. Duration Models
8. Bayesian Methods
